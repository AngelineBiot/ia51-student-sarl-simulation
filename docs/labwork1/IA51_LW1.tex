\section{Work to be Done during the Lab Work Session}

The following sections describe the work to be done during this lab work session.

\subsection{First Agent}

First, you should write an agent that is able to display ``Hello World'' on the output console.

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item create the agent type with the name \code{Agent1} (with the wizard, or by hand).
\item create the event handler that is run when the \code{Initialize} event is received by the agent. This event is fired by the platform when the agent should initializee itself.
\item write the output statement in the event handler.
\end{enumerate}

For running the agent, you should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Open the dialog box of the ``Run Configurations''.
\item On the left side, click on ``SARL Application''.
\item Click on the ``New launch configuration'' button.
\item On the right side, select the project and the agent to launch.
\item Click on ``Run''.
\end{enumerate}

\Emph{It is recommended to put a breakpoint in the event handler, and run the agent in debug mode.}

\subsection{Use the Logging Buildin Capacity}

The goal of this exercise is to use a capacity that is provided by the run-time platform, aka. buildin capacity.

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item update the agent code for using the ``Logging'' capacity.
\item May anything else be changed in the code?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spawning Another Agent}

Most of the time, a system is composed by more than one agent. This exercise will enable you to launch another agent that is displaying ``Welcome'' on the output console also.

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item create a second agent \code{Agent2}, with its \code{Initialize} event handler that is displaying the welcome message.
\item Update the code of \code{Agent1} for using the \code{DefaultContextInteractions} buildin capacity. This capacity permits to do something with the context in which the agent is living, aka. the default context.
\item Update the \code{Initialize} event handler of \code{Agent1} for spawning an agent of type \code{Agent2}.
\item create a third agent \code{Agent3}, with its \code{Initialize} event handler that is displaying the welcome message.
\item Update the \code{Initialize} event handler of \code{Agent1} for spawning an agent of type \code{Agent3}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Say Hello to Every Ones}

Agents are social entities. They are supposed to interact with other agents.
This exercice enables the \code{Agent1} to say hello to the other agents.

In SARL, the information exchanged between agents are carried out by events.
The events are put inside an interaction space of a context.
In this exercise, the default space of the default context will be used.
It is automatically accessible when using the \code{DefaultContextInteractions} capacity.

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item create the definition of the event \code{Hello}.
\item update the code of \code{Agent1} for sending the event to every one after it has spawned the other agents.
\item update the code of \code{Agent2} and \code{Agent3} for displaying the welcome message when they are receiving the hello event.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Say Hello to a Single Agent}

Broadcasting events may not be the interaction mode between two agents.
In this exercise, the \code{Hello} message will be sent only to \code{Agent3}.

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item update the code of \code{Agent1} for emiting the event with a scope retricted to \code{Agent3}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Say Localized Welcome}

Agents may have different ways for doing a specific task.
In this exercise, the agents will be enable to say "Hello" according to their own skills, i.e. their languages.

The concepts of Capacity and Skill are suitable for this task.
A capacity is the definition of functions (similar to an interface in object-oriented programming) that could be invoked by the agents. A capacity never defines the code of a function, only its prototype.
A skill is a specific implementation of a capacity (similar to object implementing an interface in object-oriented programming). The skill must provide a code for each function of the implemented capacity.

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item define the \code{SayHello} capacity.
\item define the \code{SayHelloSkill} skill, that permits to say hello in English.
\item define the \code{DireBonjourSkill} skill, that permits to say hello in French.
\item update the code of the agents, that are defined previously, for using the \code{SayHello} capacity.
\item update the code of the agents for calling the function provided by the \code{SayHello} capacity.
\item update \code{Initialize} event handler of \code{Agent2} for defining its skill that is corresponding to the \code{SayHello} capacity. It should speak English.
\item update \code{Initialize} event handler of \code{Agent3} for defining its skill that is corresponding to the \code{SayHello} capacity. It should speak French.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{General Architecture of the Pacman Simulator}

The code skeleton provides the implementation of basic simulator architecture, based on:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Environment is supported by a specific agent in order to benefit of the event-based communication provided by the \sarl language.
\item The definition of the environment content is the \code{Maze} class, which is an internal attribute of the environment agent.
\item Figure \ref{simulator:arch} shows a general overview on the architecture.
\item Figure \ref{simulator:arch1} indicates that the environment agent computes and fires \code{Perception} events to the application agents.
\item Figure \ref{simulator:arch2} indicates that the application agents fires \code{Influence} events to the environment agent, which is supposed to react to.
\end{itemize}

	\msubfigure{width=.4\linewidth}{arch2}{Receiving influences from agents}
\end{mfigures}

\subsection{Environment Perceptions}

In this excercise, you must define the algorithm for computing the perceptions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \texttt{fr/utbm/info/ia51/labwork1/environment/agent/Environment.sarl} file.
\item Show the event handler \code{on RunBeginingOfStep}. This event is self-fired in order to start a step of the simulation loop. This function sends the perception events to the application agents.
\item Find the function which computes the perceptions, and open it.
\item Write the function code in the skill in order to compute the perceptions for each agent.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Environment Actions}

In this excercise, you must define the algorithm for applying the agents' actions into the environment.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \texttt{fr/utbm/info/ia51/labwork1/environment/agent/Environment.sarl} file.
\item Show the event handler \code{on RunEndOfStep}. This event is self-fired in order to finish a step of the simulation loop. This function tries to applied the influences sent by the application agents.
\item Find the function which tries to apply the influences, and open it.
\item Write the function code in the skill in order to detect conflicts, solve them, and change the state of the grid.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ghost Behavior}

In this excercise, you must define the algorithm for the ghosts' behavior.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \texttt{fr/utbm/info/ia51/labwork1/players/Players.sarl} file.
\item Show the event handler \code{on Perception}. This event is received when the ghost agent should decide what to do.
\item Write the function code in the event handler in order to reproduce the following behavior:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item If the ghost perceives the Pacman body then
		\begin{itemize}
		\item If the pacman body has a super-power then flee
		\item Else pursue
		\end{itemize}
	\item Else
		\begin{itemize}
		\item If the ghost is at cross-road then select randomly a direction (the last selected direction should not be preferred).
		\item Else move forward.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
