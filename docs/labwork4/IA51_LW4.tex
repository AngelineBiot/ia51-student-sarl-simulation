\section{Goal of this Lab Work Session}

The goal of this lab work session is to write the internal data structure for storing the objects in the environment model.
Since the considered environment is continuous, the data structure to implement is a spatial tree (usually a quadtree).

You shall learn: 
\begin{itemize}
\item How to write a quadtree.
\item How to use the quadtree in the environment model.
\item How to write the perception algorithm based on the quadtree.
\end{itemize}

\input{../common/install}

\section{Brief Description of the Code Skeleton}

The skeleton contains a framework in the package \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.framework}.
This framework contains the abstract implementation for the execution platform.
\emph{It is recommended to read this code and the associated Javadoc.}

The package \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.labwork2} contains the code to complete during this lab work.

The subpackages are or will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.general.behavior} is the package that contains the movement behaviors (kinematic and/or steering).
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.general.tree} is the package in which you must create the spatial tree implementation.
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.general.frustum} is the package in which you must create the field-of-view implementation.
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.labwork4.environment} contains the definition of the environment and the objects inside that are specific to the lab work.
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.labwork4.gui} contains the UI for the project.
\item \texttt{fr.utbm.info.vi51.labwork4.agent} contains the code of the agent to complete.
\item The file \texttt{fr/utbm/info/vi51/labwork3/MainProgram.java} contains the main program.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work to be Done during the Lab Work Session}

The following sections describe the work to be done during this lab work session.

\subsection{Quadtree Implementation}

You must implement a data structure able to store the objects in the environment model: quadtree.
A quadtree is a spatial tree in which each node represents a part of the area, and that could be divided into four sub-area of the same size (that are then child nodes in the spatial tree).
Figure \figref{classdiagram} provides you the UML class diagram of the classes that support the quadtree. On this figure, the classes with a grey background are provided in the code skeleton.

\mfigure[p]{width=\linewidth}{classdiagram}{Class diagram for the quadtree and the frustum}{classdiagram}

You should:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item create the class \texttt{QuadTreeNode}.
\item create the class \texttt{QuadTree}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Fustrum Implementation}

One of the major missions of the environment is to compute the perception for the agents.
This computation is based on the field-of-view of each agent, aka. the frustum of the agents.
The abstract implementation for the frustum is provided.

You shall code the a circular frustum in the class \texttt{CircleFrustum}.

\subsection{Frustum Culling}

The frustum culling is the algorithm that permits to extraxct from the quadtree the objects that are in the field-of-view of a specific agent.
This algorithm is based on the iteration design pattern.
Consequently,, you shall code an iterator that:
\begin{itemize}
\item has two inputs: the root node, the shape of the field-of-view.
\item has an output: the objects in the field of view, replied in turn (according to the iteration design pattern).
\item iterates in the quadtree nodes that are intersecting the field of view.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perception Algorithm}

The computation of the perception for a specific agent is coded into the function \code{computePerceptionsFor(agent : AgentBody)} of the class \texttt{WorldModel}.

You shall code this function by using the iterator on the quadtree that was coded for the previous questions.
