 ## Content of this repository
 
 * `src/main/java/fr/utbm/info/vi51/framework` contains a very simple simulation framework (following the guidelines given during the seminar sessions) based on the [SARL agent-oriented language](http://www.sarl.io) and the [Janus platform](http://www.janusproject.io).
 * `src/main/java/fr/utbm/info/vi51/general` contains the different general libraries that are coded by the students during the lab works.
 * `src/main/java/fr/utbm/info/vi51/labworkX` contains the complete source code for a specific lab work.
